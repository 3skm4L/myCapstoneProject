            <p>Hello! My name is Bak (pronounced as the German composer J.S.Bach). I created this web app to help people explore 
                a variety of <a href="https://www.bhg.com/health-family/staying-healthy/weather-health-tips/">weather factors which may play a role in our well-being,</a> including and not limited to the following purposes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>to see if their migraine symptoms correlate with specific
                        weather conditions</li>
                    <li>to avoid or find areas with the weather conditions they hate or love</li>
                    <li>to compare their current locations
                        with a potential future location they are considering moving to</li>
                </ul>
                 <p>Whatever your reasons may be, there is wealth of weather data to explore - this web app makes
         it easier for you to do so.</p>
         <h3>Disclaimer:</h3> 
            <p>I must state that I am not a doctor or physician. I cannot and do not offer any medical advice. 
             However, from my conversations with numerous friends I know that they would like to track specific weather factors - and all have different 
             reasons - yet they cannot find a useful 
             and simple way to do so. So I created this app to fill that gap. If you are using my web app to make decisions about pain management due to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/migraine-headache/expert-answers/migraine-headache/faq-20058505">migraines,</a> 
              please consult your doctor and do not 
            rely on weather data from my web app alone.</p>

            <h2>Purposes and methodology of Sweet Spot Weather Tracking App</h2>
            <p>Sweet Spot App allows you to track inter-day (from one day to another day) and intra-day (from one hour to another hour within the same day)
                 fluctuations in:</p>
                 <ul>
                     <li>barometric pressure</li>
                     <li>temperature</li>
                     <li>wind</li>
                     <li>cloud cover</li>
                     <li>precipitation</li>
                     <li>humidity</li>
                 </ul>
                <p>These above are the main weather factors that affect our comfort while outdoors and potentially induce various health symptoms such as migraines 
                for some individuals.</p>
