            <p>Hello! My name is Bak (pronounced as the German composer J.S.Bach). I created this web app to help people explore 
                a variety of weather factors. Some may want to see if their migraine symptoms correlate with specific
            weather conditions, others may want to avoid or find areas with the weather conditions they hate or love, or yet others may wish to compare their current locations
        with a potential future location they are considering moving to. Whatever your reasons may be, there is a wealth of weather data to explore - this web app makes
         it easier for you to do so.</p>
         <p>Disclaimer: <br>
            I must state that I am not a doctor or physician. I cannot and do not offer any medical advice. 
             However, from my conversations with numerous friends I know that they would like to track specific weather factors - and all have different reasons - yet they cannot find a useful 
             and simple way to do so. So I created this app to fill that gap. If you are using my web app to make decisions about pain management due to migraines, please consult your doctor and do not 
            rely on weather data from my web app alone.</p>

            <h2>Purposes and methodology of Sweet Spot Weather Tracking App</h2>
            <p>Sweet Spot App allows you to track inter-day (from one day to another day) and intra-day (from one hour to another hour within the same day) fluctuations in barometric pressure, temperature, wind, cloud cover, precipitation, and humidity. 
                These are the main weather factors that affect our comfort while outdoors and potentially induce various health symptoms such as migraines for some individuals.</p>
